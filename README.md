# ðŸ“˜ GHCR Container Retention Policy

A GitHub action for deleting old image versions from the GitHub container registry.

Storage isn't free and registries can often get bloated with unused images. Having a retention policy to prevent clutter
makes sense in most cases.

- âœ… Supports organizational and personal accounts
- ðŸ‘® Supports multiple token types for authentication
- ðŸŒ± The docker image used is sized below 10Mi, and the total runtime is a few seconds for most workloads

# Usage

To use the action, create a workflow like this:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "5 * * * *"  # every hour

jobs:
  clean:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Delete old test images
    steps:
      - uses: snok/container-retention-policy@v3.0.0
        with:
          account: snok
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          image-names: container-retention-policy
          image-tags: test* dev*  # target any image that has a tag starting with the word test or dev
          cut-off: 2w 3d
          dry-run: true
```

For your first run, we recommend running the action with `dry-run: true`. For a personal account, just replace the `snok` org. name with the string "user".

See [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows),
for other event type triggers, if cron doesn't suit your use-case.

# Parameters

### Account

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `account: acme` for an organization named "acme" or `account: user` to signify that it's for your personal account

The account field provides the action with information on whether the workflow is run by an organization
or a user (each have different API endpoints in GitHub's package APIs). If the action should be run by an organization,
then the input also provides us with the organization name, as this is needed for calling the org. API endpoints.

### Token

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}` or `token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

The token is used to authenticate the action when making API calls to the package APIs. See dedicated sections
on extra information to know about each token type, below.

#### Classic personal access tokens

Personal access tokens must have the `packages:write` scopes.

#### Temporal tokens

If you're using a temporal token (`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`), you should note that the filtering operators
described for `image-names` below *can not be used*. Temporal tokens are not usable for the [list-packages endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/packages/packages?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-packages-for-an-organization), so we have
to work around it by calling the [get-package endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/packages/packages?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-package-for-an-organization) instead. This means `image-names` needs to contain
exact names that we can use when constructing the endpoint URLs.

For a temporal token to work, it is necessary for the repository running the workflow to have the `Admin` role
assigned in the package settings.

### GitHub app tokens

GitHub app tokens must have the `packages:write` scopes.

To fetch an app token, you can structure your workflow like this:

```yaml
- name: Generate a token
  id: generate-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- uses: snok/container-retention-policy@v3.0.0
  with:
    account: snok
    token: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
```

### Cut-off

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `cut-off: 1w` or `cut-off: 5h 2s`

Specifies how old package versions need to be before being considered for deletion.

The cut-off value parsing is handled by the [humantime](https://crates.io/crates/humantime) Rust crate.
Please take a look at their documentation if you have trouble getting it to work. If that doesn't help,
feel free to open an issue.

## image-names

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Examples**:
  * `image-names: container-retention-policy` to select the `container-retention-policy` image
  * `image-names: dev* test*` to select any image starting with the string `dev` or `test`
  * `image-names: !v*` to select any image *not* starting with the string `v`

The name(s) of the container image(s) you want to delete package versions for. Supports filtering
with `*` and `!`, where `*` functions as a wildcard and `!` means to not select image names
matching the remaining expression.

These operators are only available for personal- and GitHub app-tokens. See the `token` parameter section for more info.

### image-tags

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `image-tags: !latest`

Optionally narrows the selection of package versions based on associated tags. Works the same way as the
`image-names` parameter. See above for info on supported syntax.

Like for image-names, these operators are only available for personal- and GitHub app-tokens. See the `token` parameter section for more info.

### skip-shas

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `skip-shas: sha256:610a8286bda2dcc713754078070341b8e696be0b02c0e36b2d48f1447c7162af,sha256:a1b6216dfcb74a02b33a2ed68b5dc9c1bd6aa1552d1e377155e8cb348525c533`

Optionally protects specific package versions by their digest. This parameter was added to support
proper handling of multi-platform images. See [safely handling multi-platform (multi-arch) packages](#safely-handling-multi-platform-multi-arch-packages) for details.

### tag-selection

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `tag-selection: both` or `tag-selection: untagged` or `tag-selection: tagged`
* **Default**: `tag-selection: both`

Optionally lets you select only tagged or untagged images. Both are selected by default.

### keep-n-most-recent

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `keep-n-most-recent: 5`
* **Default**: `keep-n-most-recent: 0`

How many images to keep, out of the most recent tagged images selected, per package.

If there are 10 tagged package versions selected, after filtering on names, tags, and cut-off, and there's a keep-n-most-recent count of 3 set, then we will retain the 3 most recently created package versions and delete 7.

This parameter will not prevent deletion of untagged images, because we do not know of a valid use-case for this behavior.

The parameter can be useful, e.g., to protect some number of tagged images, so that rollbacks don't fail
in Kubernetes. See [making sure there are enough revisions available for rollbacks in Kubernetes](#making-sure-there-are-enough-revisions-available-for-rollbacks-in-kubernetes) for details.

### timestamp-to-use

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `timestamp-to-use: created_at`
* **Default**: `timestamp-to-use: updated_at`

Whether we should use the `created_at` or `updated_at` timestamp when filtering based on the `cut-off` parameter.
Also impacts the selection of the [keep-n-most-recent](#keep-n-most-recent) feature, if used.

### dry-run

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `dry-run: true`
* **Default**: `dry-run: false`

When `true` the action outputs which package versions would have been deleted to stdout, without actually deleting anything.
The output gives an accurate snapshot of what would have been deleted.

### rust-log

* **Required**: `No`
* **Examples**:
  * `rust-log: container_retention_policy=error`
  * `rust-log: info`
  * `rust-log: container_retention_policy=debug,hyper_util=info`
* **Default**: `container_retention_policy=info`

Gives users a way to opt-into more/less detailed logging.

The action uses the [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) Rust crate to define log-levels,
and any expression supported by `env_logger` should work.

If you see any weird behaviour from the action, we recommend running the action with debug or tracing logs
enabled (e.g., by specifying `container_retention_policy=debug`). Beware that if you pass a value like just `debug`,
this will enable debug logging for the action binary *and all of its dependencies*, so that could become a bit noisy.

# Examples

## Organization

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # run every day at midnight, utc

jobs:
  delete-package-versions:
    name: Delete package versions older than 4 weeks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: snok/container-retention-policy@v3.0.0
        with:
          account: snok
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          image-names: foo bar baz  # select package versions from these three packages
          image-tags: !prod !qa  # don't delete package versions tagged with 'prod' or 'qa'
          tag-selection: both  # select both tagged and untagged package versions
          cut-off: 4w  # package versions should be older than 4 weeks, to be considered
          dry-run: false  # consider toggling this to true on your first run
```

## Personal account

Comma-separated list of `image-name:version-id` for each image deleted.

## failed

Comma-separated list of images that we weren't able to delete. Check
logs for responses.

# Nice to knows

## Supported operating systems

This is a ["container" GitHub action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action).
GitHub actions running containers are currently only supported by ubuntu-runners. This is a GitHub action limitation.

## Running the application outside the action

The action is a Rust application packaged as a container, so if you prefer
to run the program elsewhere you may:

- Pull the docker image and run it with:

  ```
  docker run \
            -e RUST_LOG=container_retention_policy=info \
            ghcr.io/snok/container-retention-policy:v3.0.0-alpha2  \
            --account snok \
            --token $PAT \
            --cut-off 1d \
            --image-names "container-retention-policy*"
  ```

  See the [justfile](./justfile) `run` command for inspiration.

- Clone the repo, compile it, and run the binary directly:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:snok/container-retention-policy.git
  cargo build --release
  RUST_LOG=container_retention_policy=info \
    ./target/releases/container-retention-policy \
     --account snok \
     --token $PAT \
     --cut-off 1d \
     --image-names "container-retention-policy*"
  ```

  This is probably the simplest, if you're happy to install Rust on your machine (installation docs can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)!)

## Making sure there are enough revisions available for rollbacks in Kubernetes

If you're deploying containers to Kubernetes, one thing to beware of is to not specify retention policies that prevent you from rolling back deployments. If you roll back a deployment to a previous version, and your nodes don't have the image cached, then it will need to re-pull the image from the registry. If you're unlucky, the version might have been deleted, and you could get stuck on a bad release.

If you're following best-practices for tagging your container images, you might be tagging images with versions, dates, or some other moving tag strategy. In this case, it can be hard to protect *some* package versions from being deleted by using the `image-tags` filters. Instead, you can use the `keep-n-most-recent` argument, which will retain `n` package versions per package specified:

```yaml
name: Delete old container images

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # every day at midnight

jobs:
  delete-package-versions:
    name: Delete package versions older than 4 weeks, but keep the latest 5 in case of rollbacks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: snok/container-retention-policy@v3.0.0
        with:
          account: snok
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          image-names: foo bar baz  # select three packages
          image-tags: *  # any image tag
          tag-selection: both  # select both tagged and untagged package versions
          cut-off: 1w  # package versions should be older than 4 weeks
          keep-n-most-recent: 5  # keep up to `n` tagged package versions for each of the packages
```

The action will prioritize keeping newer package versions over older ones.

## Safely handling multi-platform (multi-arch) packages

This action (or rather, naÃ¯ve deletion of package version in GitHub's container registry, in general) can break your multi-platform packages. If you're hosting multi-platform packages, please implement the action as described below.

### The problem

GitHub's container registry supports uploads of multi-platform  packages, with commands like:

```
docker buildx build \
    -t ghcr.io/snok/container-retention-policy:multi-arch \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . \
    --push
```

However, they do not provide enough metadata in the packages API to properly handle deletion for multi-platform packages. From the build above, the API will return 5 package versions. From these five, one package version contains our `multi-arch` tag, and four are untagged, with no references to each-other:

    "metadata": {

      "package_type": "container",
      "container": {
        "tags": []
      }
    }
  }
]
```

If we delete some of these, we'll either delete some of the platform targets, or the underlying image manifests, which consequently will lead to missing-manifest-errors when trying to pull the image for any platform. In other words, deleting any one of these is bad.

### The solution

While GitHub's packages API does not provide enough metadata for us to adequately handle this, the docker-cli does. If we use `docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/snok/container-retention-policy:multi-arch`, we'll see:

```json
{
   "schemaVersion": 2,
   "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
   "manifests": [
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
         "size": 754,
         "digest": "sha256:f8bc799ae7b6ba95595c32e12075d21328dac783c9c0304cf80c61d41025aeb2",
         "platform": {
            "architecture": "amd64",
            "os": "linux"
         }
      },
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
         "size": 754,
         "digest": "sha256:a86523225e8d21faae518a5ea117e06887963a4a9ac123683d91890af092cf03",
         "platform": {
            "architecture": "arm64",
            "os": "linux"
         }
      },
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
         "size": 567,
         "digest": "sha256:17152a70ea10de6ecd804fffed4b5ebd3abc638e8920efb6fab2993c5a77600a",
         "platform": {
            "architecture": "unknown",
            "os": "unknown"
         }
      },
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
         "size": 567,
         "digest": "sha256:86215617a0ea1f77e9f314b45ffd578020935996612fb497239509b151a6f1ba",
         "platform": {
            "architecture": "unknown",
            "os": "unknown"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Which lists all the SHAs of the images associated with this tag.

This means, you can do the following when implementing this action, to protect against partial deletion of your multi-platform images:

```yaml
- name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v3.0.0
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Fetch multi-platform package version SHAs
  id: multi-arch-shas
  run: |
    package1=$(docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/package1 | jq -r '.manifests.[] | .digest' | paste -s -d ' ' -)
    package2=$(docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/package2 | jq -r '.manifests.[] | .digest' | paste -s -d ' ' -)
    echo "multi-arch-digests=$package1,$package2" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- uses: snok/container-retention-policy
  with:
    skip-shas: ${{ steps.multi-arch-digests.outputs.multi-arch-shas }}
```

This should pass the SHAs of any multi-platform images you care about, so that we can avoid deleting them.

## Rate limits

The documentation for GitHub rate limits can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

The primary request limit for users authenticated with personal access tokens is 5000 requests per hour. The primary request limit for users authenticated with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is 1000 requests per repository, per hour. Limits also vary by account types, so we use response headers coming from GitHub's API to know how many requests can be sent safely.

In addition to the primary rate limit, there are multiple secondary rate limits;

- No more than 100 concurrent requests
- No more than 900 points per endpoint, per minute, where a `GET` request is 1 point and a `DELETE` request is 5 ([source](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#calculating-points-for-the-secondary-rate-limit)).
- No more than 90 seconds of CPU time per 60 seconds of real time. No real way of knowing what time you've used is provided by GitHub - instead they suggest counting total response times.
- ~~No more than 80 content-creating requests per minute, and no more than 500 content-creating requests per hour~~

All but the last secondary limit might are handled by the action. However, secondary rate limits are subject to
change without notice. If you run into problems, please open an issue.

## Restoring a deleted image

If you accidentally delete something you shouldn't have, GitHub has a 30-day grace period before actually
deleting your image version. See [these docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/packages#restore-package-version-for-an-organization) for details.
